So until you might have understood few core things but still syntax might be irking you.

For example this,

```go
import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
  "bufio"
)
```

The above thing is to import multiple packages without typing same thing again and again like

```go
import "fmt"
import "os"
import "bufio"
```

Similar can be done for vars like,
```go
var (
  var1 = 12
  var2 = 123
  var3 = 1234
)
```

Instead of something like
```go
var var1 = 12
var var2 = 123
var var3 = 1234
```

If not assigning then don't forget to declare the types

# `godoc` the Lifesaver
To access `godoc` locally on your computer in absence of internet connection, get godoc installed when internet
is available.
To install godoc, execute the following command in shell,
```shell
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc
```
and then launch godoc server on a free port like,
```shell
godoc -http=localhost:6060 # or a port of your choice like 8888 will also work
```

Then launch your browser and to the url: [localhost on port 6060](http://localhost:6060)

# `gofmt` the Ninja
We must always format and lint our code with go fmt or golint always to avoid any errors and properly
format the whole code including indentation etc.

`gofmt` comes with standard go distribution, so no need to install it.

To do so just execute the following,
```shell
go fmt -w <filename>.go
```

# `goimports` the GoNazi Leader
The go compiler is very strict about unused imports, vars, methods/functions, etc.
So if you import some package and never use it, go compiler will yell at you like a stric PE Teacher,
so to avoid that use the utility `goimports`

To install `goimports` do,
```shell
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
```
Then use them like
```shell
goimports -w <filename>.go
```
