# The `for` loop

As we've already seen in previous post that syntax for `for` is something like,
```go
for init condition; exit condition; action {
  // more actions here
}
```

But `for` can take many more forms, like a range based,

```go
package main

import "fmt"
func main() {
  numbers := [10]{1,2,3,4,5} // I'll come to this later, as there is much much more to in arrays
  for index, value := range (numbers) { // this basically is looping through all elements of the numbers array.
    fmt.Printf("Value of numbers at index = %d, is = %d\n", index, value)
  }
}
```

So in above code we first initialize an array `numbers = {1,2,3,4,5,0,0,0,0,0}` (remember go
initializes everything with default 0 value, hence 0), then we loop through all those elements and print their
indexes and value on new line.

Now you might ask, when it came to loops, all I'm talking about is for loop, no `while` loop or `do while` loop. That is because there is no such loop in Go, haha. Okay now don't go wandering yet. To get nature of `while` and `do while` loop we use `for` itself, like following,

> while loop with for in Go

```go
for a < b {
  // do something here with a or b or anything else
}
```

> or we can have infinite loop

```go
for {
  // do something here
}
```

So now let's write our `echo` program with range based loop.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "os"
)

func main() {
  s, sep := "", ""
  for _, arg := range os.Args[1:] {
    s += sep + arg
    sep = " "
  }
  fmt.Println(s)
}
```

Now that's a lot going on there, first you might observe the `_`, that is just place holder to ignore something.
as we didn't need the index of arguments we just ignored them, this is one good feature of go, garbage handling in an elegant way.
So anything that `_` holds gets ignored.

Next is `range os.Args[1:]` especially the `[1:]` part, that basically means a sub-array from index 1 till last.
while that range is basically looping through all elements, range increments the index on it's own.

So if we do something like,
```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println(strings.Join(os.Args[1:], " "))
}
```

or even something simple like,
```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println(os.Args[1:]) // this is basically printing an array as whole without any formatting done
}
```
